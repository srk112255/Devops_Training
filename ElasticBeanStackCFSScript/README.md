  --key-name hello-world-app-ec2-key-pair \
  --query 'KeyMaterial' \
  --region eu-west-1 \
  --output text > ~/.ssh/hello-world-app-ec2-key-pair.pem

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/hello-world-app-ec2-key-pair.pem
```

## Create initial stack

This project provide a [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) script to help us deploy our project and environment.

```
./deploy.sh init
